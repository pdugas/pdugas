Iâ€™m a contract software architect and full-stack computer engineer in Canton, Georgia, USA.

I'm a C/C++ and Linux guy going way back but my coding background is sort of all over the place.
I'm currently working on an in-house project using Symfony/PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for
the backend and an SPA frontend using ExtJS/GoogleMaps/Cytoscape/Visavail.

See <https://paul.dugas.cc/> for additional background and contact info.
