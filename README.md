Iâ€™m a software architect and full-stack computer engineer in Canton, Georgia, USA. I currently
work for Cribl, Inc as tech-lead for the Edge project.

I'm a C++/Linux guy going way back but my coding background is sort of all over the place; 
C/C++, PHP, Perl, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, SQL, Bash, etc. not to mention the ancient
Lisp, Pascal, Fortran, Basic and even RPG in my way-way-back!

See <https://paul.dugas.cc/> for additional background and contacts.
