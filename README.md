Iâ€™m a contract software architect and full-stack computer engineer in Canton, Georgia, USA.

I'm a C++/Linux guy going way back but my coding background is sort of all over the place; 
C/C++, PHP, Perl, Python, Javascript, Go, SQL, Bash, etc. not to mention the ancient Lisp, 
Pascal, Fortran, Basic and even RPG in my way-way-back!

I'm currently working on an in-house project with Symfony/PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB for
the backend and an SPA frontend in ExtJS/GoogleMaps/Cytoscape/Visavail. I have full CI/CD
for testing and building container images then deploying with Terraform to local VMware/Docker
platforms for staging/testing and AWS for production. The whole stack is me alone.
